## User Experience(UX)


 - First Time User Goals. 
   1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand how to navigate through the quiz.
   2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to read the rules, questions and answers easily.
   3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be see the quiz be themed correctly and colorful to match the quiz contents.
   4. As a First Time Visitor, I want to enjoy myself with the quiz while being slightly challenged and be wanting to come back to retry the quiz with new questions.
 
 - Returning Visitor Goals.
   1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to try and beat my old score at a quicker time.
     
 - Frequent User Goals.
   1. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to complete the quiz with friends and/or family to see who thinks they know more.

This website instantly shows that the quiz is in the theme of an anime called One Piece, that is welcoming anyone to challenge the quiz. The design is simple with a colorful background and containers with a opacity so the user can still see the colorful background image. After starting the quiz, the user will be able to see the short list of quiz rules to browse through and be able to either continue or exit the quiz. If the user chooses to click continue, the user will be brought straight to the quiz questions and answers with multiple choice answers. As soon as the user clicks on the answer option they desire, it will automatically bring the user to the next question. Once the user has finished the 20 questions, a results box will pop up and give the score that the user got from the quiz. The quiz has some challenging questions to make the user want to retry and beat their last score. 

#### Colour Scheme

  - colorful background image
  - rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.65)
   
   - The main colors for the website is from a colorful background image that is themed into the quiz. rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.65) is the color I used for the containers of the information throughout the quiz and a low opacity so that the user will still be able to see the background image while playing the quiz. I believe that this compliment the quiz by making it colourful but simple and consistent, it also does not make it too complex and full of distracting images all over the website. I believe the colours and style used in this website helps make the quiz look fun and wanting the user to come back or attempt more.

##### Typography

   - Lato 
   - The Lato font is the font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Lato is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive, east to read and appropriate.

    
#### Imagery

  - Imagery is important however having too many images can be distracting in certain websites. I believe using one big colorful image as a background and using the simple color of while with a low opacity to give the website a clean yet slightly colorful website without being too distracting.

## Credits

#### Contents
     
  - Some of the questions in the quiz are from the top of my head as I am a huge fan of the Anime, however the majority of the harder questions I found and was taken from the website https://twinfinite.net/2021/01/hardest-one-piece-quiz-youll-ever-take/
  
  - The layout of the quiz is set up in the form of how majority quizzes are, so I thought i'd keep it simple and familiar.
  
#### Media
       
  - The image throughout the website was just from a google images searches of 'One piece backgrounds'.


#### Acknowledgements

-   I'd like to say and give a HUGE thanks to my Mentor Antonio for continuously helping with the struggles and the consistent feedback and ideas throughout the project.
